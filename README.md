# COMP-3940 Project: Multi-Pong Game

---
## Description

---
Group Project for COMP-3940: Client/Server Systems Development Fundamentals. 
This project showcases the implementation of our cumulative learnings earlier in the semester about Socket Programming (COMP 3940), and various Programming Design Patterns (COMP 3522). Combined with the usage of Raylib, we were able to graphically demonstrate the core fundamentals of the Client/Server Model with the game, Pong.
## Technologies Used:

--- 
- C++
- Socket Programming
- Raylib
## How to run our game, Multi-Pong

---
1. `git clone` our repo: COMP3940Project.
2. Build `client.exe`.
3. Build `server.exe`.
4. Execute `server.exe` on the machine that you wish to host the game.
Note: You may execute `client.exe` on the same machine that `server.exe` has been executed on. If you decide to do so, please state "**localhost**" as the IP address you wish to 'connect' to, and provide "**8888**" as the Port when prompted by the resulting command line that shows up upon execution of `client.exe`.
5. Please distrubute your public IPv4 Address to the players that will execute `client.exe`, and the number "**8888**" as the Port Number to connect to.
6. Please instruct the second player to execute `client.exe`. 
7. Please input the above values given to you to connect to the computer that has executed `server.exe` 
(The IP address to provide should be the public IPv4 Address of the Host computer, and the Port Number should be **8888**).
8. At this point one player should've connected to the Server by now. As soon as the Second player joins, the game will begin.
9. Enjoy our Game!
